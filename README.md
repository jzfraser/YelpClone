# YelpClone
A fullstack app to help me learn how to make CRUD apps using PostrgreSQL, Express, React, and Node.
This has been made based on the tutorial found at https://youtu.be/J01rYl9T3BU from freeCodeCamp.
I have made some very minor alterations and the ratings system has not been implemented as I was content with the learning from the first section.

## Instructions
* npm install must be ran in both the client and server directories
* PostgreSQL must be installed and running on your device with the correct environment variables set in /server/.env
  * If you made a PostgreSQL database elsewhere to connect to, then set the environment variables for it instead
* Start the client and server nodes by executing npm start in the /client and /server directories
